# Project 2: Landing Page

Completed as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Project description:
This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. A starter code was given but I have decided to start from scratch. 

## Project Requirements: 
- Build out your HTML and have at least 4 content sections.
- Dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.
- The section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. 
- When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport
